# psychic-game

##The Psychic Game asks us to set up a page that allows the user to choose letters off the keyboard in an attempt to guess the letter that he computer has chosen at the onset of the page loading.  The user gets 9 tries before the game resets and either credits the user with a win or a loss.  In addition to this, the computer should log each of the users guesses on the screen until the user reaches their 9th guess, after which the guesses list resets (the guesses list resets earlier if the user chooses the correct letter and wins the game).

<p>As you can see by the git timestamp, in a rush to get the homework submitted I:</p>

1. Forgot to actually submit the homework on the bootcamp website
2. Forgot to update a read me file.

<p>I'm now submitting the readme late.  I hope you can forgive me and not 

##Issues I ran into

+ I was having some issues understanding how you can simply create a variable with a function in it and then call the variable to get the function to run, but I'm understanding that now.
+ I was also having some major issues with linking items in nthe Javascript with items in the body of the HTML using getelementbyID, I resolved this but am definitely looking forward to getting more acquainted with JQuery.
+ Just generally, I'm not very good at picking up minute errors in my code and am still getting quite frustrated when I get stuck on de-bugging, I'd be open to any feedback on how to work on this skill.

I enjoyed this homework assignment.  Apologies for turning this in late.  That being said, you can see from my git commits that I did finish it on time.

Thanks,
Louis Henning
